ResonantFilterBank
==================

A Web Audio API fixed frequency resonant filter bank based roughly on the architecture of the Moog 914 module.

Next things I want to add:

&bull; Controls for filter frequency and resonance

&bull; Argument to set number of filters to build

&bull; Implementation of Zach Denton's custom-built filters: http://noisehack.com/custom-audio-effects-javascript-web-audio-api/

&bull; Implementation of a modulation matrix
