ResonantFilterBank
==================

A Web Audio API fixed frequency resonant filter bank based roughly on the architecture of the Moog 914 module.

Next things I want to do:

&bull; Debug for Safari and Firefox

&bull; Add controls for filter frequency and resonance

&bull; Add argument to set number of filters to build

&bull; Implement Zach Denton's custom-built filters: http://noisehack.com/custom-audio-effects-javascript-web-audio-api/

&bull; Implement a modulation matrix
